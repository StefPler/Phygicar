This project was introduced in the V as in MetaVerse Hackathon 2022.

The idea: In the process of buying a car, we provide a secure way to doublecheck the details of the car and the service history from the day, manufactured.
The car is stored on blockchain as an nft, and we use dynamic fields for the service logs attached on the nft object of the car.

The project is a draft of the idea presented on the last day of the hackathon.

In the project, you can find a move package with smart contract, written in sui move and deployed (published) in Sui Devnet v0.19.0. It also includes a PWA, using ionic framework with angular. 

The team: Andreas Xydas, George Digkas, Stefanos Pleros, Maria Siopi
